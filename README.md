## General overview

MusicBreakdown gives you the wave visualizer and tempo of any audio file.

### Backend

MusicBreakdown is built using wavesurfer-js and beats-audio-api. I added additional functionality to wavesurfer.js by allowing users to upload their own audio files instead of having to insert a link to one.

## Built With

* [wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer-js.org/) - For the wave visualizer & the sound controls.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For the wave visualizer & the sound controls.
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icons
* [beats-audio-api](https://github.com/JMPerez/beats-audio-api/) - Tempo calculator
